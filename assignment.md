# Kotlin Essentials (Interfaces and Abstract Classes + Generics)
---
The Kotlin assignment has two components
- Practice with Interfaces and Abstract Classes.
- Practice with Generics.

> Note: You must save your solution in `solution_part1.kt` for Part I, and `solution_part2.kt` for Part II.

## Part I - Interfaces and Abstract Classes.
---
- Create an example of, a Class and an Interface, and allow to Implement the Interface methods and variables in the Class.
- Create an example of, a Class and an Abstract Class, and Implement different methods, variables, and Abastract methods from the Abstract Class
